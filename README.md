Welcome to CS-573 - Introduction to Cybersecurity

Instructor: Dr. Edward Amoroso, eamoroso@tag-cyber.com

Classes will be held on Monday evenings starting on January 6, 2025 at 6:30PM in Edwin A. Stevens 222.

The style of this course involves in-class lectures which I strongly urge you to attend. The grading rubric is as follows: 40% midterm, 40% final, 20% class attendance/participation. I ask that you purchase and quickly read the following book - perhaps even in advance of attending the lectures. It is an inexpensive book and a very quick read, but will help ensure that you have a basic grounding before we get into more detailed discussions:  https://www.amazon.com/CIA-APT-Introduction-Cyber-Security/dp/1522074945Links to an external site.. After each lecture, I will post the PowerPoint charts that I used during the lecture.






Midterm Examination Due, March 24 (take-home examination) 

Step 1.  Pick twenty-four (24) specific companies or organizations that are reasonably well-known (make sure they are real). Step 2.  Create a fictitious description of an attack that you predict could happen to each organization. Step 3.  Also create a description of how each attack could have been prevented from occurring. Step 4.  Write forty-eight (48) PowerPoint charts showing. (a) 24 attack scenarios and their predicted date in next two years. (b) 24 descriptions of how the attack could have avoided. Step 5.  I will grade you on your creativity, originality and your ability to describe realistic attacks into the future. Step 6.  I also know what and how ChatGPT generates output â€“ so an obvious ChatGPT-oriented answer will receive a grade of C.
